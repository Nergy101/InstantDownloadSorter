# How to run

Option 1:
Have Python 3 installed and available in PATH as either `py` or `python`.
Use the shell scripts.

Option 2:
go inside CMD at `/src` and:
- run the `setup.py` with python
- run `InstantSorter.py` with python

Just like in the `shell` scripts, basicly.

`setup.py` asks you to input your downloads-folder location. 
This gets stored inside `settings.json` and can also be set manually.
